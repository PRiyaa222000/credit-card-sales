Project Highlight: Credit Card Transaction & Customer Weekly Analytics Dashboard 
I’m excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard project, where I’ve used real-time data from Kaggle's credit card transaction dataset and customer weekly reports to provide key insights into card operations.
Key Features:
*KPIs for Total Revenue, Interest, Income, and Age to track financial performance 
*Quarterly Revenue & Transaction Count visualized with Line & Stacked Column Charts 
*Weekly Revenue comparison by Gender using a dynamic Line Chart 
*Chip Usage Analysis with Stacked Column Charts 
*Revenue Comparison based on Expenditure, Education, and more using Bar Charts 
*Gender Insights via a Tree Map for easy segmentation 
*Slicers for interactive filtering by Quarter, Card Category, and Chip Usage 

I utilized DAX Queries to calculate complex metrics, ensuring real-time updates for accurate decision-making. The main objective was to build a comprehensive dashboard that allows stakeholders to instantly analyze performance trends and make informed decisions on card operations.
Why It Matters:
This dashboard empowers decision-makers by providing real-time insights, helping to identify trends, optimize financial strategies, and improve customer experience—all with a simple, interactive interface.
